              <h2>Technology for Lawyers</h2>
              <p>
                This site focuses on helping attorneys understand and utilize new and existing technologies
                to help their practices grow. We hope to encourage attorneys and their firms to use these technologies
                to become more efficient, more productive, and more secure in their practices.
              <h3><strong>Efficiency</strong></h3>
              <p>
                As attorneys, we, and those who work in our offices, have many routine tasks that need to be accomplished daily. Although
                we know that not everything can be automated, by taking the time to create mechanisms for
                tasks on the front-end, an office can open its staff up to focusing on other tasks that may require
                a greater degree of finesse.
              </p>
              <p> From simple solutions like using <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-or-run-a-macro-c6b99036-905c-49a6-818a-dfb98b7c3c9c">macros</a>
                that import your letterhead into documents at the touch of a button, to implementing
                document creation software, a more efficient practice allows an attorney to serve more clients.
              </p>
              <h3><strong>Productivity</strong></h3>
              <p>
                Obviously, an attorney and his or her staff do not want to work around the clock,
                but that shouldn't mean that the office fully shuts down. Through the use of
                websites, we attempt to allow a user to learn information about our offices at any
                time. Why then shouldn't we allow a client to interact with certain parts of our
                offices on their schedule. Incorporating payment portals into a website is a
                simple way of increasing our office's productivity without increasing personnel's
                workload.
              </p>
              <h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>
              <p>
                In order to take advantage of all that technology has to offer us, we must
                first verify that we are keeping our assets and our clients' information secure. This does
                not, however, just mean securing our data from an outside actor who is looking to breach our
                system. We must also make sure that we are securing our assets and data from threats to
                their integrity and availability. Having a system in place to recover corrupted or lost data
                is just as important as making sure that your firewall is secure.

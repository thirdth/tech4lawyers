<p>In civilized life, law floats in a sea of ethics. -- Earl Warren</p>
<h2>Ethics of Security -- making sure your data are secure</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  In what I consider a delayed response to the market, many states, including my own
  are now adopting rule of conduct designed to keep pace with ever-changing technology
  and the business practices that come from that.
</p>

<p>
  Since most of the rule changes are crafted in accord with the ABA Model Rules, we will
  use those as our guide, however, your state may or may not have adopted these changes
  at all, or may have adopted them in a modified way. As always, go to your relevant
  legal source.

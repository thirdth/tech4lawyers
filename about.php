            <h2>What we do:</h2>
            <p>
              The goal of <strong>Tech4Lawyers</strong> is to help attorneys gain
              the insight they need in order to increase their productivity and efficiency,
              and to understand the security risks, if any, associated with this. We
              create websites, write articles on useful technologies, and produce software
              applications that aim to make particular parts of the legal practice quicker,
              easier, and safer. We don't have all the answers, but its a start.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Articles</strong></h3>
            <p>
              First and foremost, we want attorneys to become more familiar with
              technologies that are available to them and best practices around those
              technologies. We focus on providing information related to increasing
              efficiency, productivity, and security in small to medium sized firms.
              We want attorneys to have the tools to make sound, reasoned choices
              about how to implement advancing technology into their practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Secondly, we want to make sure that attorneys are able to gain a better
              understanding of these technologies in general. We believe, for example,
              that if an attorney knows specifically what a Denial of Service (DDoS)
              attack is, one can better advise his or her clients on how to protect
              themselves against them.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Website Development</strong></h3>
            <p>
              We also offer website development services to attorneys. Because we believe
              that there is more out there than just Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
              Attorney websites and their domains should not just be a sunk cost for
              advertising, they should be a tool that provides value while you sleep through
              mechanisms like online pay-portals and client appointment requests.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Tutorials</strong></h3>
            <p>
              As a supplement to our Articles, we will also create step-by-step tutorials
              explaining common ways to implement some of the practices that
              we write about. Hopefully, if there are practical and sufficient tutorials
              already created on a subject, we will be able to direct the reader to
              those as well.

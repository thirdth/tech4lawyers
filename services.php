            <h2>Website Development:</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Tech4Lawyers</strong> provides two different types of website development depending on a client's needs.
              The simplest, and most affordable approach is to set-up a content management site for the client like Wordpress or Drupal.
              While the second is a comprehensive approach where the design, deployment and hosting of the website is done solely by <strong>
              Tech4Lawyers</strong>.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Content Management</strong></h3>
            <p>
              This method is suggested if you would like to maintain control over the content of the website and keep it up-to-date
              by making changes to the copy yourself, or maintaining a blog for your firm. One does not need to know how to code, or
              how to write in the specific languages browsers understand. Both Wordpress and Drupal are user friendly and allow
              users to intuitively change the content of their websites.

            <p>
